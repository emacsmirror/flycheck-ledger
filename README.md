flycheck-ledger
===============

This library provides a [flycheck][] checker for [Ledger] files.

Installation
------------

You'll need Emacs 24 for `flycheck`, so the recommended way to get
`flycheck-ledger` is as a package from the [MELPA][melpa]
repository. The version of `flycheck-ledger` there will always be
up-to-date.

If you insist on doing things the hard way, first ensure `flycheck` is
installed, then download this code and add the directory to your Emacs
`load-path`.

Then, in your `init.el`:

```elisp
(eval-after-load 'flycheck
  '(require 'flycheck-ledger))
```

Make sure that the `ledger` binary is present on Emacs' `exec-path`, or
customize `flycheck-ledger-executable` to point to the `ledger`
binary.

Usage
-----

When `flycheck` is enabled (e.g. with `global-flycheck-mode`), `ledger-mode`
buffers will be automatically checked using this checker.
